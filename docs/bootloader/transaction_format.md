# Transaction format

ZKsyncOS expects transactions with the following fields:

| `reserved_dynamic`        | `bytes`      | Field used for extra functionality.  Currently, it's used for access and authorization lists. The field is encoded as a list, to be able to extend it in the future. The field is encoded a the ABI encoding of a bytestring containing the ABI encoding of the list itself. Currently the list contains 2 elements. First, the access list: encoded as `tuple(address, bytes32[])[]`, i.e. a list of (address, keys) pairs. Second, the authorization list: encoded as `tuple(chain_id, address, nonce, y_parity, r, s)[]`.                                                  |

Transactions are encoded using the tightly packed ABI encoding for this list of fields. All numeric types are encoded as big-endian `U256`. Encoding and hashing of transactions is implemented in this [module](../../basic_bootloader/src/bootloader/transaction/mod.rs).
